Hi!

This repo have some little projects I've done to practice building websites.
For most of these I've used just plain old HTML+CSS+Javascript, except for some more complex ones, where React/Next.js was used.

All the code is done by me and you're free to use it as you want, but keep in mind that the designs are **not** mine.
All the designs are from [this](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl) wonderfull post.
